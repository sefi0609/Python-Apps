# To-Do list web 
### A to-do list web app with date, camera and gallery
I have added a requirements.txt file just in case you want to deploy the app.  
you can take a picture of yourself and save it,  
you can upload photos.
I have added just for fun the Astronomy Picture of the Day,  
From the NASA open APIs.
